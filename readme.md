Sapper game for few players with chat based on websockets, 
python as backend and js as frontend. Game is on 
the stage of development :)

*To quick start:*

> git clone https://github.com/InfiSupaSta/Websocket-sapper.git
>
> virtualenv venv
> 
> source venv/bin/activate
> 
> pip install -r requirements.txt
> 
> python3 ./backend/core.py
 

Run ./frontend/index.html using web-server (for example, 
PyCharm built-in web server on port 63342 or use 
the Live Server Extension in VS Code).
